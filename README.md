# Facial Recognition Security System - Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project turns a servo motor in order to unlock a door when the Raspberry Pi detects the user's face.
The `train_model.py` is used to create a haarcascade xml file given the images inside of dataset.
The `run_servo.py` is the script to run in order to detect faces and turn the servo accordingly.
